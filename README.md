## Background
     ```Frigyes Karinthy introduced the concept of 'six degrees of separation' in a short story in 1929. The idea proposes that any given person can be connected with any other person by a chain of familiarity that is comprised of no more than 6 individuals. The concept later found colloquial implementation as a game called "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" in which participants attempt to connect actor Kevin Bacon with any other actor by films the actors have mutually appeared in.
     Small-world networks serve as an intuitively useful mathematical model for these chains of interconnectivity. This type of graph consists of nodes which are connected by edges and is characterized by the traits that no single node is neighboring most other nodes, but most nodes are connected by a small number of node-edge steps.```
